* Little Lemon is a local neighborhood bistro, both the owners have long understood the importance of digital presence as a means of convenience and connection for their visitors.
* So far, I helped Little Lemon by building a prototype of their website using the Django framework.
* I had been instrumental in testing different website components, from creating views to dynamic templates and building models and forms.
